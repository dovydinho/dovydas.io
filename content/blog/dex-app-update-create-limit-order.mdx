After initial release of my DEX application, I decided to go back and improve its functionality, specifically for creating limit orders. 
First iteration of **_Create Limit Order_** function was very basic. 
It validated if the user has sufficient amount of tokens (USDC if BUY order and selected token if SELL order). 
If passed, it simply pushed a new order to the orders array after collecting user inputs for amount and price to be traded for. 
It did not account for wider range of possible scenarios which could occur in real world conditions.

<br />
Unaccounted scenarios when creating limit orders:
- Matching price order (or multiple orders) is already available for ***partial*** order fill.
- Matching price order (or multiple orders) is already available for ***full*** order fill.
- Matching price order is submitted by the same user.

First, form validation has been added to Front-End of the application to avoid wasting gas fees for no tangible outcome. 
It checks and prevents smart contract function submissions when invalid inputs, i.e., zero value, invalid fractional digits, are submitted.

<br />
Then, after permissive inputs are submitted, application calls smart contract Create Limit Order function. 
Validation on smart contract checks the before mentioned statements:

- User shall have enough USDC to execute order, if the order is to ***BUY*** tokens.
- User shall have enough tokens to execute order, if the order is to ***SELL*** tokens.

Continuing on, two sets of data arrays are taken from the smart contract. 
One for orders which match the side (BUY or SELL) of the submitted order, other for opposite side orders.

<br />
A new variable called ***remaining*** is set to initially match the trade amount submitted by the user.

If there are any opposite side orders available, a while loop checks for orders which offer the exact or better price for the submitted order and if the remaining amount is greater than zero.

All new orders are sorted by price; therefore, the while loop needs to repeat until the first false condition is met.

<br />
When while loop condition is ***true***, function is progressed in the following sequence:
1. Additional check is made, to see if the matching order is ***NOT*** placed by the new limit order initiator before continuing with the code block. 
If the pair is matched - order is skipped and the while loop checks other order iteration. 
If the next iteration returns ***false*** loop condition, the while loop is concluded.
If the next iteration returns ***true***, following code block logic is applied.
2. Available amount for the matched order is compared with the ***remaining*** amount to check which one is greater. 
3. Remaining amount is deducted by the matched amount and new trade event is triggered.
4. Balances are updated for both, matched and new order owners.

In a scenario where multiple opposite side orders are suited for match; the above loop will continuously run and execute until the remaining amount is exhausted. 
Fulfilled orders are then removed from the opposite orders array.

  When removing elements from an array from a loop using&nbsp;
  <a href="https://devdocs.io/javascript/global_objects/array/pop" target="_blank">
    .pop()
  </a>
  &nbsp;function, the length of an array is reduced; therefore, it is easy to skip an element when incrementing the iteration count.

If there are not enough trade events which could exhaust the ***remaining*** amount of the submitted order, a new limit order is created and pushed to the orders array. 
The array is then sorted by price.
