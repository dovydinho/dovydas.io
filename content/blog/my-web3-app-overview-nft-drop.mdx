Non-Fungible Tokens or NFTs for short have really picked up the pace in terms of search volume since early 2021 and it's been on top for many conversations ever since. 
This new trend of ownership of digital things have created a north of billion-dollar marketplace accessible for all.

<a href="https://nft-drop.dovydas.io" target="_blank">“NFT Drop”</a> is an open-source project with collections of digital artworks available to mint. 
It showcases the most widely use case for NFT projects. 
Newly minted NFTs are available on <a href="https://opensea.io" target="_blank">OpenSea</a> (most popular NFT marketplace) and can be transfered or listed for sale if owner decides to do so.

<br />
Artworks used for collections of this demo project are not unique. 
They are copies of few of the most recently trending NFT collections.

Front page of the application displays all available collections. 
This is an alternative to an artist gallery, showcasing work of different lyrical subjects at a physical galleria.
<br />
The website is architected for its content (NFT collections) to be easily modified by authenticated user with the use of <a href="https://sanity.io" target="_blank">Sanity</a> CMS (Content Management System). 
All collections with their unique data are stored on Sanity and linked with Smart Contract functionality with the help of <a href="https://thirdweb.com" target="_blank">Thirdweb</a>.

Available functionality for NFT Collection owners:
- Set a royalty fee (in %) for each of the sale of NFT on owners collection.
- Set fee for minting a new NFT on the collection (ETH, WETH or USDC Coin).
- Limit how many seconds do wallets have to wait in-between claiming.
- Limit who can claim NFTs first (per set duration and amount).

When browsing the application Metamask should be connected to "Goerli Test Network" (ref. image below) as smart contract is deployed on the testnet.
Goerli testnet Ether is used for gas fees when interacting with the application (i.e., mint an NFT).

## Final Thoughts

NFTs are opening doors for a lot of creative projects to be built using ERC721 and ERC721 Standards.

Building NFT Drop project gave me first hands experience with most popular NFT trend - NFT Collections and Minting new NFTs. 

Looking at NFT space overall, there is a lot of similar attempts of catching the next trend in NFTs but majority lack innovative ideas.

Tools like Thirdweb gives a strong foundation for rapid development when building standardized applications. 
Since the code on the platform is audited developers can be less stressed about potential vulnerabilities on their smart contracts.

<br />
Key skills improved or acquired during development:

- Using <a href="https://thirdweb.com/" target="_blank">Thirdweb</a> for smart contract deployment.
- Data link between smart contracts and CMS (<a href="https://www.sanity.io" target="_blank">Sanity</a>).
- Advanced the development experience with TypeScript.
