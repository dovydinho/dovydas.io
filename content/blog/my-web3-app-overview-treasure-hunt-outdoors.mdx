One of the first Web3 projects which I built for my portfolio is titled [“Treasure Hunt Outdoors”](https://treasure-hunt-outdoors.dovydas.io), and is available on the [showcase](/showcase) page.
It's inspired by an outdoors andventure game <a href="https://www.geocaching.com" target="_blank">Geocaching</a>, where users interact with the app to look for caches hidden and pinned on the map by other community members.

<br />
Smart contract for the application is built with Solidity, and powered by Ethereum
blockchain. Anyone using Metamask wallet can connect to the application and start
interacting.

<br />
The main goal with Treasure Hunt Outdoors project was to develop an operational Web3
application for my portfolio with fully tested smart contract. I will share some
insights and overview about the project.

When browsing the application Metamask should be connected to "Ropsten Test Network" (ref. image below) as smart contract is deployed on the testnet.
Ropsten testnet Ether is used for gas fees when interacting with the application
(f.e. to locate an existing or hide a new treasure).

Community page displays the summary of all user activity.
A total count for both located and hidden treasures is displayed for each user (unique wallet address) seperately.
User wallet address excerpts are used instead of usernames.

To list a new cache, user must connect to Metamask and have Ropsten Test Network selected. Some amount of Ropsten Ether should be avilable in the wallet to complete the transaction.

On the listing page ("Hide a Cache") there is a simple form requesting some descriptive information about the cache:

- Title - it is visible on game map, treasures list and individual treasure page.
- Hint - it can be a direct description of the exact location or a riddle to make it more playful.
- Location - it should be pinned on the game map as close to the actual cache location as possible.

Information available on the treasure page (`/treasures/{treasure contract address}`):

- Address of the treasure.
- Address of treasure creator (owner).
- Amount of times the treasure has been located by participants.
- Hint to help locate the treasure (set by the creator of the treasure).
- Location on the map with latitude/longitude coordinates.
- Click-to-action button to mark treasure as located.
- Community logs (list of users who have found the treasure).

## Smart Contract

There are two smart contracts used for the application.

First, **Treasure Factory contract** which is mainly responsible for storing a collection of all treasures and overall user activity.

Second, **Treasure contract** which is dedicated to an individual treasure. It stores data about the treasure and allows it to be located.

Treasure Factory contract has the "createTreasure" function which enables users to create new treasures.
A new instance of Treasure smart contract is deployed when a new treasure is created.
It also has few helper functions:

- getAllHiders - to retrieve a an array of unique users who have created treasures.
- getTreasureContracts - to retrieve all deployed treasure contract addresses.
- getUsersActivity - to retrieve an array of all user activity.

Treasure contract has "locateTreasure" function which allows users to log themselves on the app when they locate the treasure.
It also has a helper function "getTreasureSummary" which retrieves all treasure data in a single smart contract call.
This avoids the need to call smart contract to retrieve each peace of data about the treasure seperately.

## Testing Smart Contract

Since smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain are immutable, the most critical phase before deployment is to ensure that the smart contract is absent of any coding errors and thoroughly tested.

There have been a total of 12 smart contract tests written and asserted for this project:

#### For Treasure Factory Contract:

- Should add creator to hiders array ONLY IF not added yet.
- Should return correct number of hiders.
- Should return correct number of treasures.
- Should NOT add creator to hiders array if already added.

#### For Treasure Contract:

- Should have correct initial data.
- Should add activity to factory contract when treasure is created.
- Should locate treasure and increment located count.
- Should add activity to factory contract after treasure is located.
- Should NOT locate treasure if locator is creator of treasure.
- Should NOT locate treasure if locator has already located treasure.
- Should delete treasure contract and remove from treasures list.
- Should NOT delete treasure if function caller is NOT the creator of treasure.

## Final Thoughts

This concludes a high level overview of my Treasure Hunt Outdoors application.

There is a list of functionality enhancements that I have in mind if I ever decide to supplement the project in the future.
For now, I think the state in which it is currently in meets my set-out goals.

<br />
Key skills improved or aquired during development:

- Deploying a smart contract from other smart contract.
- Interactive <a href="https://leafletjs.com" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> map integration.
- The beauty of <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a>.
