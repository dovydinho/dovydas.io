Blockchain applications flourishes best at disrupting centralized services. 
There are a lot of project funding programs which allow creators to receive income from their supporters, 
however it is usually shadowed by service fees, censorship and unknown activities behind the doors. 
Web3 can solve this by managing all of financial activities with open-source smart contracts. 
This ensures transparent flow of funds and trust in execution.

<br />
This article shares an overview for 
<a href="https://crowdfund.dovydas.io" target="_blank">“Crowdfund”</a> portfolio application built on Ethereum.
It showcases how smart contracts can be integrated and merged with centralized backend data.
This solution enables better user experience via faster fetching of data for user interface without sacrificing the transparency of smart contract execution.

Strategy behind the architecture of the application was to minimize data stored on smart contracts, narrowing it down to essentials. 
Rest of the data which is linked to smart contracts is stored on centralized database. 

Without the centralized data feed there would be no technical obstacles for smart contracts to operate as designed. 
However, it would lose the helper data assigned to smart contracts which provide users more details about the project fund (i.e., title, description, images). 
This is a tolerable risk for most of web3 applications as centralized data could be replicated and deployed on different service provider. 
Therefore, the approach of separating of non-essential data from smart contracts is very common.

The page for creating new projects has a live preview section to show how the project card is going to look on the homepage. 
This style is also replicated on search results component.

When browsing the application Metamask should be connected to "Goerli Test Network" (ref. image below) as smart contract is deployed on the testnet.
Goerli testnet Ether is used for gas fees when interacting with the application (i.e., create project, add and remove contributors, sponsor, etc.).

## Smart Contract

Similar to 
<a href="http://dovydas.io/blog/my-web3-app-overview-treasure-hunt-outdoors" target="_blank">Treasure Hunt Outdoors</a> 
portfolio project, there are two smart contracts used for the application.

First, **Project Crowdfund Factory** contract which is mainly responsible for storing a collection of all projects.

Second, **Project Crowdfund** contract which is dedicated to an individual project. It stores essential data and functionality for the project (i. e., balance, contributors, sponsors, ability to unlock and distribute funds, etc.).

#### Project Crowdfund Factory:

- Stores array of projects.
- Keeps an overall projects count.
- Allows to create projects.
- Allows owners to remove their projects (external function).

#### Project Crowdfund:

- Stores owner wallet address.
- Stores factory contract address.
- Stores array of contributors and contributors count.
- Stores array of sponsors and sponsors count.
- Keeps creation timestamp.
- Keeps target amount.
- Allows to periodically unlock and keeps unlocked amount.
- Keeps next available unlock timeframe.
- Allows to unlock and distribute funds to contributors.
- Allows contract to receive funds.
- Gets summary data in a single smart contract call.

## Testing Smart Contract

Since smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain are immutable, the most critical phase before deployment is to ensure that the smart contract is absent of any coding errors and thoroughly tested.

There has been a total of 28 smart contract tests asserted for this application:

#### For ProjectCrowdfundFactory Smart Contract:

- Should create new ProjectCrowdfund contract with correct values and increment projects count.
- Should remove existing project and decrement projects count.
- Should NOT create new ProjectCrowdfund if target is not set.
- Should NOT remove project if function is called NOT by project owner.

#### For ProjectCrowdfund Smart Contract:

- Should create new ProjectCrowdfund contract with correct values.
- Should edit target.
- Should add contributor and increment contributors' count.
- Should remove contributor and decrement contributors' count.
- Should fund contract and set sponsored amount for sponsor.
- Should fund contract and append existing amount to sponsor if already a sponsor.
- Should unlock amount and set new next unlock time.
- Should distribute funds to contributors.
- Should deactivate project.
- Should activate inactive project.
- Should get project summary and match data.
- Should destroy project and send funds to owner.
- Should NOT add contributor if initiator is not owner.
- Should NOT add contributor if contributor already exist.
- Should NOT remove contributor if contributor does not exist.
- Should NOT remove contributor if contributor is owner.
- Should NOT remove contributor if initiator is not owner.
- Should NOT unlock amount if unlock period not passed.
- Should NOT unlock amount if balance is zero.
- Should NOT unlock if remaining funds to unlock is zero.
- Should NOT deactivate project if not owner.
- Should NOT activate project if not owner.
- Should NOT destroy project if not owner.
- Should NOT destroy project if active.

## Final Thoughts

There is a great potential for web3 applications when merging smart contract functionality with externally stored data. 
Storing non-essential data in smart contracts is highly inefficient which arguably is even an understatement. 

True adoption comes in stages. 
Therefore, I think joint decentralized and centralized solutions is a path we must take to excel in blockchain adoption.

<br />
Building Crowdfund application gave me new perspectives on how write more efficient smart contracts. 
Also, I feel that I added great tools to my web3 development stack. 

<br />
Key skills improved or acquired during development:

- Developing Smart Contracts with <a href="https://hardhat.org/" target="_blank">Hardhat</a>.
- Using <a href="https://docs.ethers.io/ethers.js/v3.0/html" target="_blank">Ethers.js</a> library for Front-end.
- Hands-on experience with TypeScript.
- Data link between smart contracts and CMS (<a href="https://www.sanity.io" target="_blank">Sanity</a>).
