Over the past few years, there have been a rapid increase in blockchain projects which enable the use of smart contracts.
These projects allow to create new tokens which share a common technical standard.
This standard enables the tokens to be interchangeable with each other.

<br />
Platform where users can trade their tokens is commonly called an Exchange or DEX
(Decentralized Exchange). DEXES have become an integral part of all blockchain ecosystems
which allow smart contract and token creation.

<br />
This article shares an overview for one of my portfolio projects
<a href="https://dex.dovydas.io" target="_blank">“Decentralized Exchange”</a> built on Ethereum.

In Ethereum ecosystem, ERC-20 is the technical standard for fungible tokens which can be interchangeable with each other.
Smart contract for Decentralized Exchange is deployed on Ethereum testnet, therefore
ERC-20 tokens listed on exchange are also only testnet representations. USDC stablecoin
(testnet token) is used for trade settlement.

All tokes which are traded on the exchange must be first approved by the token holder to allow the smart contract to execute trades for these tokens.
Wallet section (ref. image below) helps distinguish tokens approved for trading from those available on the wallet.
User can withdraw and deposit available tokens at any time.

An open orderbook shows all active orders on the exchange.
Trading chart is available showcasing price changes per each executed trade.
A more common solution for such trading charts is to show price changes based on time intervals.
However, since it is a low volume application, I decided to display price changes per executed trades count.

Order book for all active trades is available for each token.
There is a separate section to display active orders placed by the authenticated user.
Orders can be canceled by their owners at any time if it's not yet fulfilled.
Tokens for active limit orders are subtracted from the wallet and are not available for withdrawal.
It is then returned if the order is canceled or distributed according to the trade settlement.

When browsing the application Metamask should be connected to "Ropsten Test Network" (ref. image below) as smart contract is deployed on the testnet.
Rinkeby testnet Ether is used for gas fees when interacting with the application (f.e. deposit, withdraw, create new trade).

## Smart Contract

There are several smart contracts used for the application.
`DEX.sol` is the main smart contract. Other smart contracts are ERC-20 instances for tokens to be used on testnet.

DEX smart contract enables users to make instant trades (market orders) and to set orders which would be executed if desired price is met (limit orders).

#### Market order functionality ensures the following:

- User has sufficient balances when placing orders.
- Orders are fulfilled starting from the first order in the order book (order book is sorted when placing limit orders)
- Balances for impacted orders and amounts are update after executed trades.
- Fulfilled orders are removed from the orderbook.

#### Limit order functionality ensures the following:

- User has sufficient balances when placing orders.
- Order amount is subtracted from user balance (return if trade is canceled).
- Order is executed if a matching price is available on the order book.
- If the order is not matched, it is added to the order book.
- Order book is sorted by order price.

## Testing Smart Contract

Since smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain are immutable, the most critical phase before deployment is to ensure that the smart contract is absent of any coding errors and thoroughly tested.

There have been a total of 22 smart contract tests written and asserted for this application:

#### For DEX Smart Contract:

- Should deposit tokens.
- Should NOT deposit tokens if token does not exist.
- Should withdraw tokens.
- Should NOT withdraw tokens if token does not exist.
- Should NOT withdraw tokens if balance too low.
- Should create limit order.
- Should create limit order and partially fill if order is available for execution
- Should execute limit order fully if orders are available for execution.
- Should append to existing order if same price order is available for order creator.
- Should ignore oposite side orders by the same user when creating limit orders.
- Should NOT create limit order if token balance too low.
- Should NOT create limit order if usdc balance too low.
- Should NOT create limit order if token is USDC.
- Should NOT create limit order if token does not not exist.
- Should create market order & match.
- Should NOT create market order if token balance too low.
- Should NOT create market order if usdc balance too low.
- Should NOT create market order if token is USDC.
- Should NOT create market order if token does not not exist.
- Should delete order.
- Should book funds when order is placed.
- Should return funds when order is canceled.

## Final Thoughts

Decentralized Exchanges have become an integral part of DEFI (Decentralized Finance).
Empowering users to transact freely without the need to trust any third party mediary shows the true potential of Web3.

Financial applications should adopt only the highest quality code with thorough testing to minimize risk for potential malicious acts.

Building this kind of application, gives valuable skills and perspective to understand smart contracts used in DEFI and the importance of writing high quality code.

<br />
Key skills improved or acquired during development:

- Hands-on experience with smart contracts used in DEFI applications.
- Sending initial transactions during deployment.
- Modern and interactive <a href="https://apexcharts.com/" target="_blank">ApexCharts</a> API integration.
- Advanced smart contract testing.
